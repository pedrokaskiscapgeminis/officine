          Hello! My name is Sam! The boss is on vacation and forgot to turn in
          his TPS report. We usually don't like being in his office, but the
          team needs that report turned in by the end of the day.

          Should we call him on vacation or leave him to enjoy the Caribian

          What is this thing? Is it like a retro way to store your contacts?
          Someone called it a Rolodex . . . it sounds like they're just making
          up words. If he uses this, then who knows where he stores that report.

          Good to see that he's using social media all day. I don't even want to

          I thought the company was doing better than this. It seems that they
          are selective on what they tell the designers. It looks like a missing
          TPS report is the least of our problems

          Half of these awards are just participation certificates for HR
          outings. That trophy doens't even have his name on it. I think he got
          it from a thrift store and was hoping no one would look that closely
          to it.

          He uses this every day and his golf game still sucks. I'm not the
